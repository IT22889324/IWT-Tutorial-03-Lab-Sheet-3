1. Create a html file and save it as “test_css1.html”. Then include the following HTML code to the
file.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Testing CSS</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>This page is to practice CSS</h2>

        <p> Usually, CSS is written in a separate CSS file or in a style tag inside of
        the head tag, but there is a third place which is also valid. The third place
        you can write CSS is inside of an HTML tag, using the style attribute</p>

        <p>Internal or embedded CSS requires you to add style tag in the head
        section of your HTML document. This CSS style is an effective method of
        styling a single page</p>

        <p>External CSS contains separate CSS file which contains only style
        property with the help of tag attributes. CSS property written in a separate
        file with css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using
        link tag</p>
    </body>
</html>

    2. you can create classes of styles that can then be used on many different HTML elements
    3. consistent look and feel across multiple web pages
    4. improved load times because the css file is downloaded once and applied to each relevant page as needed
